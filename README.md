# Digital Twin for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project aims to build a **Digital Twin system for predicting Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD)** using a hybrid machine learning approach:
- **ACO (Ant Colony Optimization)** for feature selection
- **SMOTE** for data balancing
- **CNN** for classification
- **Bayesian Optimization** for hyperparameter tuning

---

##  Files Included

- `digital-twin-for-cvd-using-aco-smote-cnn-bo.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all steps
- `new dataset.csv` – The dataset (CVD-related) used in the project

---

##  Dataset

The dataset used is **"Heart Disease Dataset (Comprehensive)"**, originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/heart-statlog-cleveland-hungary-final). 

---

##  Libraries and Frameworks Used

- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn** – For ML utilities, evaluation, and train/test splitting.
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** – For handling imbalanced datasets.
- **DEAP** – For implementing Ant Colony Optimization.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – For building and training the CNN model.
- **Scikit-Optimize (skopt)** – For Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.
